## Cucumbers on Vine Hill

[Everyone's invited](features/step_definitions/weather_report_steps.js) to my party:

* [cucumber-electron](https://github.com/featurist/cucumber-electron) runs scenarios in a browser that's also a node.js
* [hyperdom](https://github.com/featurist/hyperdom) renders dynamic HTML
* [httpism](https://github.com/featurist/httpism) talks to the server
* [express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) powers the back end web API
* [browser-monkey](https://github.com/featurist/browser-monkey) interacts with web pages and asserts
* [vinehill](https://github.com/dereke/vinehill) cuts out HTTP to keep tests fast and repeatable

Check out the [client](app/client.js), [server](app/server.js), and [step definitions](features/step_definitions/weather_report_steps.js)
